# CreditGuard

Creditguard is a machine learning model for credit risk assessment. This project focuses on predicting whether a loan application will be accepted or rejected based on relevant features.

## Project Status

:warning: **Project Status: Halfway Done** :warning:

The current version of Creditguard is a work in progress. While the model is capable of predicting accepted loan applications, work is ongoing to enhance its capabilities by incorporating transfer learning to predict if a loan application is  gonna get rejected. This update is probably gonna make the model much more accurate at predicting if your loan application is gonna be accepted or rejected.

## Features

- **Acceptance Prediction:** The model can predict whether a loan application is likely to be accepted.
- **Transfer Learning:** In progress - Utilizing transfer learning to enhance the model's ability to predict loan rejections.


## Dataset


The accpetence part is trained on the lending club loan dataset
